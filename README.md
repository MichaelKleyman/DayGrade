# Daygrade

Daygrade is fullstack progressive web application, with secure user authentication catered specifically to the end user, to collect and visualize data overtime. This application is a progressive mental health tool and a framework for growth. It aims to help individuals improve their strive for daily improvement in their lives, by consistently tracking their activities throughout the day, and giving each day a score from a scale of 1-10. This system assesses how well the individual managed their time and energy throughout the day, including their ability to prioritize self-care and maintain a healthy work-life balance. With a dynamic and responsive user interface, it has cross-platform capability, fast load time, and offline accessibility.


## Demo
Users are able to create accounts and log in, to log every part of their day, and at the end of each day, submit a score from 1-10, on how they feel their day was. Overtime, these scores appear on a chart to display your progress. Each checkin can be looked back at to understand the patterns of ones life and if it overall contributes to their goals and productivity.
